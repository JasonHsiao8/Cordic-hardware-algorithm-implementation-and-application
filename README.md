CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) is an iterative hardware algorithm based on simple additions/subtractions and bit shifts. It can compute trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponentials, logarithms, multiplication, division, square, and square-root. And it is widely used in digital signal processing(DSP), embedded systems and FPGAs.
