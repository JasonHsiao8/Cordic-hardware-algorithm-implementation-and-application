# Cordic-hardware-algorithm
**CORDIC**(**CO**ordinate **R**otation **DI**gital **C**ompute) is a digital algorithm used to compute trigonometric functions, square roots, logarithms, and other mathematical operations. Its main idea is to approximate the desired results through a series of vector rotations.  
**Basic concepts** : 1. Vector rotation 2. Using addition and shift instead of multiplication 3. Multiple iterations
