# Cordic-hardware-algorithm
CORDIC is a digital algorithm specifically used to compute trigonometric functions, square roots, logarithms, and other mathematical operations. Its main idea is to approximate the desired results through a series of vector rotations.
Basic concepts : 1.Vector rotation 2.Using addition instead of multiplication 3.Multiple iterations
